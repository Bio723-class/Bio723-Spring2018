# Make your solutions computable

For each of the problem below (except in cases where you are asked to discuss your interpretaion) write R code blocks that will **compute appropriate solutions**. A good rule of thumb for judging whether your solution is appropriately "computable" is to ask yourself "If I added additional observations to this data set, would my code still compute the right solution?"


# Data set: NC Births data

This assignment uses the Spellman yeast gene expression data set introduced in class

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bio723-class/example-datasets/master/spellman-combined.txt


# Problems

  1. In the lecture notes we walked through a series of steps showing how to take the raw Spellman data and turn it into a tidy, long data frame by dropping empty and unneeded columns, reshaping, etc.  For the purposes of illustration, the exposition in the hand out out was broken into multiple code blocks and included some extra steps.  

    Write a *single code block* that shows how to go from the original data (`spellman`) to a tidy, long data frame (`spellman.final`) *in as few steps as you can while still maintaining correctnes and clarity of your code*.  Include comments where you feel they are appropriate, to explain what your code is doing. [5 pts]

  
  1. Show how to find the 1000 most highly expressed genes across any of the treatments, in the data [3 pts]

  1. What is the size of the overlap between the 1000 most highly expressed genes and the 1000 most variable genes (see lecture notes) ? [2 pt]
  
  1. Create a heat maps depicting the time dependent expression of top 50 most highly expressed genes in the cdc15 experimental conditions, sorted vertically in descending order by maximum expression *in the cdc15 experimental conditions* (i.e. the gene with the highest overall expression in cdc15 should be at the top of the plot).
