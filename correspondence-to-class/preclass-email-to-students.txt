Dear Bio 723 participants,

As you are aware, the Spring 2018 semester begins tomorrow, Wednesday, January 10.  However, due to the way the Duke academic calendar is structured, the Monday class meeting schedule is in effect on the 10th. As a consequence, the first official Bio 723 class meeting period is  **Wednesday, January 17**.

Since our first class session is delayed a week, I'd like you to complete some basic tasks **BEFORE** our first class session.  This will allow us to get a jump start on our journey into statistical computing!


1. Checkout the course wiki at https://github.com/Bio723-class/Bio723-Spring2018/wiki

2. Install the latest versions of R and RStudio on your computer

    - The latest version (3.4.3) of R can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/index.html

    - RStudio is a convenient "front end" for working with R. You can download the free, open-source version of "RStudio Desktop" from this link: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/


3. Read the "Lecture 0: Getting Started With R" document on the course wiki  and work through the included examples


Bio 723 assumes you've got a working familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g. what would typically be covered in an intro biostats course).  This would include familiarity with standard measures of location (mean, median), spread (variation, standard deviation), and association (covariance, correlation) as well as working familiarity with the "standard toolbox" of statistical methods commonly employed in biological studies (t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression, Chi-squared tests, etc).  

If your stats skills are rusty, a nice resource to review is a series of columns published in Nature Methods, entitled "Points of Significance". These points of significance columns review key statistical concepts, with the "working biologist" in mind.

I look forward to meeting you all in person on the 17th!

Best wishes,
Paul Magwene
